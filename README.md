# BBsFirstFlaskService
A demonstration of a Python/Flask/React microservice

(These instructions are mostly for me to remember)
THE BACKEND
To run this service you will need a version python 3 installed. I am running this on a windows machine so my commands will be windows-centric
1. run `python -m venv <name>` to create a virtual environment with your version of python
2. run `source <name>/Scripts/activate` (bash emulator on windows command) to activate the virtual environment
3. change to the api folder and run `python -m pip install -r requirements` to install project requirements in your env
4. start the app by running `flask run`

THE FRONTEND
You will need node.js installed to run this i think
1. npm start (and thats it I think??)
